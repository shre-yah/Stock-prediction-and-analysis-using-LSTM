## Introduction

Captures the logos around through camera and detects the name, then it analyze it's past stock price and predicts it for future.

With the evolving era of technology, machine learning has become increasingly popular in predicting stock market prices for trading.
In order to improve the accuracy , we combined hardware and software by using a camera
to capture company logos and Google Vision API to detect the company
associated with it. 

 From here , we scraped live data from Yahoo Finance
(yfinance) to analyze and make informed investment decisions. We conducted
an exploratory data analysis(EDA) using Seaborn plots and maps to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the trends and patterns in the stock market
data. 

By analyzing this data, we can make more informed investment
strategies.. We used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to predict
the future stock prices of a specific company. 

This approach for stock
prediction can help investors make more informed decisions and can
potentially increase their return values. By this technology, we can optimize
the process of stock prediction and improve investment outcomes.
